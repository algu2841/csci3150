    <h1> My Favourite Book</h1>
    <p>
        My favourite book is <em>The Book Thief</em> by Markus Zusak.
        He is an Australian author who published the book in 2005.
        That said, <strong>the book is a piece of historical fiction set during WW2 in Nazi Germany</strong>.
        You can find out more information about the plot on
